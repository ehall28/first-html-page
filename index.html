    <h2 id="lmp"><u>Lemon Meringue Pie</u></h2>
    <img height="180" src="./lmp.jpeg">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp pure icing sugar</li>
        <li>125g salted butter</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tbsp iced water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lemon filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup cornflour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups caster sugar</li>
        <li>60g butter</li>
        <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour and icing sugar into a large bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Add the water and use a round-bladed knife to stir until a dough forms. Use your hands to bring the dough together in the bowl. Turn onto a sheet of non-stick baking paper and roll out to a 5mm-thick disc. Use the pastry to line a 23cm (base measurement) pie dish. Trim excess pastry. Cover the pastry with baking paper. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Fill the lined dish with pastry weights or rice. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and pastry weights or rice. Bake for a further 15-20 minutes or until crisp and golden. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to make the lemon filling, combine the cornflour, water, lemon juice and half the sugar in a saucepan. Use a balloon whisk to stir over medium heat for 4 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for a further 1 minute. Remove from heat. Whisk in butter and egg yolks. Transfer to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 3 hours or until cooled completely.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 190°C. Use an electric beater to beat the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoonful at a time until the mixture is thick and glossy.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling over the base of the pastry case. Spoon over the meringue mixture and spread to the edge of the pastry. Use the back of a spoon to create peaks. Bake in oven for 5 minutes or until the meringue peaks are light golden. Set aside to cool completely. Serve.</li>

    <h2 id="ap"><u>Apple Pie</u></h2>
    <img height="230" src="./ap.jpg">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (260g) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75g) self-raising flour</li>
        <li>185g unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (75g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chilled water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>Demerara sugar or caster sugar, to sprinkle</li>
        <li>Ice-cream, to serve</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>45g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>8 large apples</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon ground</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flours and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Add butter and rub lightly into flour with your fingertips. Lift mixture high above the bowl as you rub, to incorporate air into the pastry and make it lighter. Continue until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir through sugar. Lightly beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon chilled water, then drizzle over flour mixture. Start to bring the dough together by cutting the liquid into the dough with a blunt knife, then form into a smooth ball with your hands, adding a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the filling, peel and core the apples, and cut each into 8 pieces. Toss immediately with lemon juice in a large bowl, to prevent apples from discolouring. Place the butter and sugar in a large frypan over medium-low heat. When butter has melted, add apples and spices, then stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until apples have softened. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Roll out the larger pastry ball on a floured workbench to a 30cm circle (about 2mm thick). Roll pastry around rolling pin, then unroll over a 22cm metal pie dish. Gently press into corners and allow excess to overhang. Place filling in base with a slotted spoon. Roll the small pastry piece to a 25cm circle. Beat remaining egg with milk, brushing some on rim of the base. Top with small pastry.</li>
        <li>Lift the pie dish and cut excess pastry from edges with a sharp knife. Crimp edges of pastry together the tail of a spoon. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180C, place pie dish on a baking tray and cut air vents in the centre of the pie. Brush top of pie with more beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara or caster sugar and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
